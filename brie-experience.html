                            I'm a young, remote-working professional out of Atlanta, GA. I have 30+ plants and one very old dog who is my baby. 
                            I began my professional career in the arts and have since moved into software engineering and web developement. I attended NuCamp Coding Bootcamp, and have several Google Career Certificates.
                            I love horror and art, and write frequently.
