                                    I'm a young, remote-working professional out of Atlanta, GA. I have 30+ plants and one very old dog who is my baby. 
                                    I began my professional career in the arts and have since moved into software engineering and web developement. I attended NuCamp Coding Bootcamp, and have several Google Career Certificates.
                                    I love horror and art, and write frequently.

                                    I spend most of my time perfecting my portfolio and working on freelance projects.
